Welcome to this read-me ðŸ˜Š

This is a semester project at Noroff, Front-end education.

Where on this site is it clickable?

- First movie on page is clickable (this will go to the single product page).
- The cart button in nav will show you items in your cart. The checkout button will take you to the success-page. 
- If you go to the "All movies"-page and size down to mobile-size - you will be able to click on the "Categories"-text.
A burger menu will show up from right, containing the categories. 

I know the code could be shorter and more efficient. Specially on the Index/Styles. For me, it was important to get everything up and go. 

My inspiration for the design was mostly Hbo, Disney+, Netflix etc - and some other shopping sites like Zalando, Zara etc.
I went for a really simple design - and this turned out to be quite perfect since its my first full website project. 
My biggest challenge was definitely the burger-menu's. 

Im sorry the repo is messy - i totally forgot to add the css files into one directory. Will fix this later. 

Im overall very happy how it turned out - and i have learned A LOT. 
Looking forward to future projects!

(by the way - if you like my work, feel free to reach out!)
